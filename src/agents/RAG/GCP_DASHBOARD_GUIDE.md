   - Click "Create Dashboard"

2. **Add Widgets**
   - **System Health**: Add scorecard showing pod health
   - **CPU Usage**: Add line chart for CPU usage by agent
   - **Memory Usage**: Add line chart for memory usage
   - **Network Traffic**: Add line chart for network I/O
   - **Error Rates**: Add scorecard for error counts
   - **Response Times**: Add line chart for agent response times

3. **Configure Metrics**
   - Use the metric filters from the JSON file
   - Set appropriate time ranges (1 hour, 6 hours, 24 hours)
   - Add alerts for critical thresholds

### **Option 2: Import JSON Configuration**

1. **Download the JSON file**
   - Use `nfrguard_dashboard.json` created by the script
   - This contains pre-configured widgets and metrics

2. **Import in GCP Console**
   - Go to Monitoring > Dashboards
   - Click "Import" and upload the JSON file
   - Customize as needed

### **Transaction Processing Volume**
- **What it shows**: Number of transactions processed per minute
- **Why it matters**: Business activity and system load
- **Alert threshold**: Unusual spikes or drops in volume

### **Error Rate**
- **What it shows**: Number of errors per agent
- **Why it matters**: System reliability and stability
- **Alert threshold**: Any errors detected

### **Pod Health Status**
- **What it shows**: Health status of each pod
- **Why it matters**: Infrastructure stability
- **Alert threshold**: Any pod showing unhealthy status

## üö® **Setting Up Alerts**

### **Critical Alerts**
1. **High CPU Usage** (>80%)
2. **High Memory Usage** (>500MB)
3. **Pod Restarts** (>0)
4. **Error Rate** (>0)
5. **Response Time** (>5 seconds)

### **Warning Alerts**
1. **CPU Usage** (>60%)
2. **Memory Usage** (>400MB)
3. **Network Latency** (>1 second)
4. **RAG Query Latency** (>2 seconds)

### **How to Set Up Alerts**
1. Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/monitoring/alerting?project=gen-lang-client-0578497058
2. Click "Create Policy"
3. Add conditions for each metric
4. Set notification channels (email, Slack, etc.)
5. Test the alerts

## üìà **Custom Metrics for AI Agents**

### **Agent-Specific Metrics**
- **Risk Score Distribution** - How risk scores are distributed
