INTRODUCTION\n        This Prudential Practice Guide provides guidance on the application of Prudential Standard CPS 230 Operational Risk Management.\n        \n        2. OPERATIONAL RISK IDENTIFICATION\n        APRA expects an APRA-regulated entity to identify operational risks through:\n        (a) internal and external risk assessments;\n        (b) analysis of operational risk incidents;\n        (c) scenario analysis;\n        (d) key risk indicators; and\n        (e) risk and control self-assessments.\n        \n        3. OPERATIONAL RISK ASSESSMENT\n        An APRA-regulated entity should assess operational risks by considering:\n        (a) the probability of occurrence;\n        (b) the potential impact on the entity;\n        (c) the effectiveness of existing controls;\n        (d) the quality of risk management processes; and\n        (e) the entity's risk appetite and tolerance.\n        \n        4. INCIDENT MANAGEMENT\n        APRA expects an APRA-regulated entity to have incident management processes that:\n        (a) promptly identify and report incidents;\n        (b) assess the significance of incidents;\n        (c) investigate significant incidents thoroughly;\n        (d) implement appropriate corrective actions;\n        (e) monitor the effectiveness of corrective actions; and\n        (f) learn from incidents to improve risk management.\n        \n        5. RESILIENCE AND RESPONSE\n        An APRA-regulated entity should maintain resilience by:\n        (a) having robust business continuity plans;\n        (b) testing business continuity arrangements;\n        (c) maintaining alternative arrangements;\n        (d) having effective communication plans;\n        (e) ensuring adequate resources for crisis management; and\n        (f) learning from exercises and incidents.\n        ",
