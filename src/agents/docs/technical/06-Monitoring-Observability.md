# üìä Monitoring & Observability Guide

## What You Need to Monitor

When running AI agents in production, you need to watch three main things:

### 1. **Infrastructure Health** üèóÔ∏è
**What it is:** Making sure your servers and network are working
**What to watch:**
- Are your pods running? (`kubectl get pods`)
- How much CPU and memory are they using? (`kubectl top pods`)
- Are services talking to each other properly?
- Is the database responding?

### 2. **AI Agent Performance** ü§ñ
**What it is:** How well your AI agents are doing their jobs
**What to watch:**
- How fast do agents make decisions?
- How accurate are their risk assessments?
- Are they detecting fraud properly?
- Are they following compliance rules?

### 3. **Business Impact** üí∞
**What it is:** The real-world results of your AI system
**What to watch:**
- How much fraud have we prevented?
- How many customers are happy vs frustrated?
- Are we staying compliant with regulations?
- How much money are we saving vs human security teams?

## Simple Monitoring Setup

### What We Already Built For You

We've set up monitoring that tracks:

#### **Custom AI Metrics**
- **Risk Scores** - How suspicious each transaction looks
- **Processing Times** - How fast agents make decisions
- **Success Rates** - How often agents make the right call
- **Compliance Checks** - Whether regulations are being followed
- **Sentiment Analysis** - How customers are feeling
- **Privacy Violations** - When personal data gets leaked

#### **Infrastructure Metrics** 
- **Pod Health** - Which services are running
- **Resource Usage** - CPU, memory, network usage
- **Error Rates** - How often things break
- **Response Times** - How fast the system responds

## How to See Your Monitoring

### Option 1: Google Cloud Console (Easiest)
1. Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/monitoring?project=gen-lang-client-0578497058
2. Click "Metrics Explorer"
3. Search for "nfrguard" to see your AI agent metrics
4. Look at "Kubernetes Engine" to see infrastructure health

### Option 2: Command Line (Quick Checks)
```bash
# See if all your services are running
kubectl get pods

# See resource usage
kubectl top pods

# Check specific service logs
kubectl logs deployment/frontend --tail=50

# See agent performance in real-time
python demo/enhanced_database_monitor.py
```

### Option 3: Real-Time Demo Monitoring
Your demo script shows live agent performance:
```bash
cd demo
python enhanced_database_monitor.py
```

This shows you:
- Real transactions being processed
- How each agent responds
- Risk scores and decisions
- Customer sentiment analysis
- Privacy violation detection

## Key Metrics to Watch

### üö® **Alert-Worthy Metrics**
- **High Risk Transactions** - More than 10 per hour
- **Slow Agent Response** - Taking more than 5 seconds
- **Failed Compliance Checks** - Any compliance failures
- **Negative Customer Sentiment** - More than 5 complaints per hour
- **Privacy Violations** - Any PII leaks detected

### üìà **Performance Metrics**
- **Transaction Volume** - How many transactions per hour
- **Agent Accuracy** - How often agents make correct decisions
- **System Uptime** - How often the system is available
- **Customer Satisfaction** - Percentage of positive sentiment

### üí∞ **Business Metrics**
- **Fraud Prevention** - Dollar amount of blocked fraudulent transactions
- **Compliance Score** - Percentage of transactions that pass regulatory checks
- **Cost Savings** - Money saved vs human security team
- **Customer Retention** - How many customers stay vs leave

## Setting Up Alerts

### Google Cloud Alerts
We've created alert rules that notify you when:
- Risk scores get too high (>0.9)
- Compliance checks fail
- Privacy violations are detected
- Customer sentiment turns negative
- Agents take too long to respond

### How to Enable Alerts
```bash
# Apply alert policies
gcloud alpha monitoring policies create --policy-from-file=monitoring/alert_policies.yaml
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "Agents aren't responding"
**Check:** `kubectl get pods` - are all pods running?
**Fix:** Restart failed pods with `kubectl delete pod <pod-name>`

### "Risk scores seem wrong"
**Check:** Look at recent transactions in the demo
**Fix:** Verify transaction data is reaching the agents properly

### "Customer complaints are high"
**Check:** Sentiment agent logs and customer messages
**Fix:** Review why transactions are being blocked unnecessarily

### "System is slow"
**Check:** `kubectl top pods` - is CPU/memory usage high?
**Fix:** Scale up resources or optimize agent processing

## Best Practices

### Daily Monitoring Routine
1. **Morning:** Check overnight alerts and system health
2. **During Day:** Watch real-time metrics and demo performance
3. **Evening:** Review daily performance reports

### Weekly Review
1. **Performance Trends** - Are agents getting faster/better?
2. **Business Impact** - How much fraud prevented this week?
3. **Customer Feedback** - Are sentiment scores improving?
4. **System Health** - Any recurring issues to fix?

### Monthly Analysis
1. **Cost-Benefit** - How much are we saving vs human teams?
2. **Accuracy Improvements** - Are agents learning and getting better?
3. **Compliance Audit** - Are we meeting all regulatory requirements?
4. **Customer Satisfaction** - Overall sentiment trends

## Pro Tips

### Start Simple
- Begin with basic infrastructure monitoring (pods, resources)
- Add AI metrics gradually as you understand the system
- Focus on business impact metrics that matter to stakeholders

### Use Visual Dashboards
- Google Cloud Console has built-in dashboards
- Create custom dashboards for your specific needs
- Share dashboards with team members for transparency

### Set Realistic Thresholds
- Don't alert on every minor issue
- Focus on metrics that indicate real problems
- Adjust thresholds based on actual performance patterns

### Monitor Trends, Not Just Current Values
- Look for patterns over time
- Identify when things are getting better or worse
- Use historical data to predict future issues
