🛡️ Resilience Agent: 🚫 TRANSACTION BLOCKED
   Customer account temporarily frozen
   Investigation initiated
   Customer notification sent
```

### Scene 5: Customer Reaction (1 minute)
**Show:** Customer sends angry message: "Why was my transaction blocked? This is ridiculous!"
**Say:** "The customer is frustrated, but watch how the AI handles this..."

```
💬 Customer Message: 'Why was my transaction blocked? This is ridiculous!'
😊 Customer Sentiment Agent: 😠 NEGATIVE sentiment
   Negative indicators: 2
   Alert: Customer satisfaction at risk
😊 Ops Alert: negative sentiment
   Escalating to customer service team
   Proactive outreach initiated
🏦 Banking Assistant: 🤝 CUSTOMER SERVICE ACTIVATED
   Automated response sent to customer
   Explanation: 'Transaction blocked for security review'
   Alternative: 'Please contact support for assistance'
```

**Say:** "The sentiment agent detected the frustration and immediately escalated to customer service, while the banking assistant sent a helpful automated response. This prevents the situation from getting worse."

### Scene 6: Privacy Protection (1 minute)
**Show:** System log containing customer email
**Say:** "Meanwhile, the privacy agent is scanning all system logs..."

**Show:** Privacy detection:
```
📝 Log Entry: Transaction processed for customer@email.com
🔒 Data Privacy Agent: 🚨 PII VIOLATION DETECTED!
   Personal information found in log
   Action: Log sanitized, alert generated
🔒 Privacy Violation: PII_in_log violation
   Severity: medium
   Log sanitized, alert generated
   Compliance team notified
```

**Say:** "The privacy agent found personal information accidentally logged and immediately sanitized it. This prevents data breaches and keeps us compliant with privacy laws."

### Scene 7: Knowledge Summary (1 minute)
**Show:** Knowledge agent report
**Say:** "Finally, the knowledge agent creates a human-readable summary..."

**Show:** Report generation:
```
📚 Knowledge Agent: 📊 GENERATING INCIDENT REPORT
   Risk Event Summary:
   - Transaction: $25,000.00
   - Risk Level: HIGH
   - Actions Taken: Blocked, Account Frozen
   - Customer Impact: Negative sentiment detected
   - Privacy Issue: PII in logs
   Report sent to compliance team
```

**Say:** "This report goes to human security teams, giving them everything they need to understand what happened and take further action if needed."

### Scene 8: Summary (30 seconds)
**Show:** All agents working together
**Say:** "In just 3 seconds, 7 AI agents coordinated to prevent fraud, ensure compliance, protect privacy, and maintain customer satisfaction. This is the future of banking security!"
